All critical issues have been resolved in the codebase. Theme tokens are unified, the navigation now routes to the consolidated Platforms page, hero sections share the animated backdrop with accessibility guards, background effects respect motion preferences, contrast overlays are in place, the layout grid is consistent site-wide, and the English translations have been rewritten per the approved copy.
