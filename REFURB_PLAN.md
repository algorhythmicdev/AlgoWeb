# AlgoWeb Refurbishment Plan

## Vision & Outcomes
Deliver the refreshed AlgoRhythmics experience outlined in `designUpdate.pdf`: unified story-driven hero moments, OS-inspired surfaces, and an accessible colour system that achieves WCAG AAA across light, dark, and high-contrast modes. The finished site should communicate the brand pillars (AlgoRhythmics, NodeVoyage, Ideonautix) with consistent voice, motion, and theming.

## Design Direction & Palette Notes
- Core surfaces: `Aurora Mist` (light), `Midnight Nebula` (dark), `Obsidian Matrix` (high-contrast) with glass overlays for depth.
- Brand primaries: `Voyage Blue` for navigation & CTAs, `Aurora Purple` accents, `Signal Yellow` highlight for key metrics; `Cherry Red` limited to alerts.
- Supporting neutrals follow new scale (`--neutral-050` â€¦ `--neutral-950`) to harmonise data visuals and copy blocks.
- Motion language: subtle parallax, beam/halo animations; defer to `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility.
- Typography: maintain Inter/Space Grotesk pairing with updated tracking and weight guidance per tokens file.

## Progress Snapshot (2025-02-15)
- [x] Refresh global design tokens with new brand palettes, neutral ramps, and typography guidance (`src/lib/styles/tokens.css`).
- [x] Apply frosted OS-window shell styling to shared layouts (`src/lib/styles/global.css`, hero/CTA components) and document usage.
- [x] Remove redundant hero badges/micro-titles; expand headline/body copy so each hero communicates the full product promise.
- [x] Enlarge product demo preview frames, add beam/orb treatment, and improve responsive behavior.
- [ ] Ship hero narrative polish (update storytelling beats, CTA hierarchy, and imagery references) per section checklist below.
- [ ] Resolve CSS minifier warnings in `ProductDemoPreview` keyframes and audit related animation utilities.
- [ ] Finish dark/high-contrast theme polish (background surfaces, cards, focus states, header text-fit issues).
- [ ] Final accessibility + visual regression pass across all modes/devices.

## Hero Overhaul Checklist
- [ ] Landing hero: align copy to "Think Faster. Ship Smarter." positioning, confirm gradient/readability across all themes.
- [ ] Community hero: ensure the manifest message loads on first paint, embed community metrics, and remove placeholder badge.
- [ ] Products hero: reinforce "Platform constellation" narrative; verify animated headline contrasts with background.
- [ ] Consulting hero: integrate client testimonial callout with new palette.
- [ ] Contact hero: harmonise CTA trio with OS-window shells and update map accent colours.

## Colour System Revamp
- [x] Map light theme surfaces/buttons/typography to new tokens.
- [ ] Dark theme: tune neutrals, nav background, and OS-window borders to hit AAA contrast.
- [ ] High-contrast: ensure base background swaps, CTA/button states, focus rings, and alerts satisfy AAA ratios and avoid colour clashes.
- [ ] Document palette usage in README/design notes for future contributors.

## Remaining Workstreams & Tasks

### 1. Animation + Build Hygiene
- [ ] Fix malformed `@keyframes` definitions in `src/lib/components/ProductDemoPreview.svelte` to remove minifier warnings.
- [ ] Update `src/lib/utils/animations.js` (or dependent modules) to reference new `.os-window` class where `glass-card` was used.
- [ ] Re-run `npm run build`; ensure zero warnings and document results.

### 2. Theme Polish & Accessibility
- [ ] Dark theme: adjust neutral surfaces, card backgrounds, and header containers for consistent contrast (target WCAG AAA on primary text/buttons).
- [ ] High-contrast mode: ensure base background swaps, CTA/button colors, and focus rings meet AAA ratios; verify nav hover/active states.
- [ ] Confirm hero sections (landing, community, products, consulting, contact) communicate full value without auxiliary badges.
- [ ] Verify header layout accommodates long labels in all breakpoints and themes.

### 3. QA & Documentation
- [ ] Visual smoke test per route (desktop + mobile) in light/dark/high-contrast modes; capture issues for follow-up.
- [ ] Accessibility sweep (keyboard focus order, reduced motion, screen reader landmarks).
- [ ] Summarize findings, confirm readiness for sign-off, and prep release notes.

## Next Checkpoint
After completing Workstream 1 and the hero overhaul checklist, regroup to review visual diffs/screenshots and confirm no regressions before final QA.
