# Progress Log

- Implemented the IG-grade hero animation system from **site vision.pdf**, covering aurora-flow, glass-parallax, grid-ripple, particle-drift, and line-sweep variants plus the new typographic reveal headline treatment and neutral hero overlays.
- Delivered the AAA-aligned interaction system from **site vision.pdf** with neutral primary/secondary CTAs, high-contrast-aware chip and badge tokens, table and input guardrails, and theme switching upgraded to the light/dark/HC map with `hc` compatibility in the progress toggle.
- Routed the products, community, consulting, and contact heroes through the shared **HeroBackdrop** system so each page now uses a distinct spec-aligned animation combo with HC/reduced-motion fallbacks tuned to the token map.
- Re-authored the entire English locale file with welcoming, tech-friendly language while preserving placeholders and aligning copy with the calm, AAA-focused design vision.
- Completed the remaining interaction refinements from **site vision.pdf**: elevated form feedback with helper copy and alert icons, delivered full roving tabindex + arrow-key control for the language switcher, and added Vitest coverage for theme persistence and translation loading guardrails.
- Stabilized the new accessibility helpers by replacing invalid Svelte bindings, wiring an action-based focus registry, and tuning FieldSupport styling so builds succeed cleanly alongside passing Vitest runs.
- Replaced the remaining `glass-card` surface classes with the refreshed `os-window` shell, updated the shared animation utilities to drop legacy normalization, and synced the build pipeline so `npm run build` runs warning-free after `svelte-kit sync`.
- Trimmed the unused glass morphism helpers, constrained os-window normalization to the new shell semantics, and updated the UI/UX improvement plan to reflect the renamed surface guidance.
- Migrated the home story shell and timeline preview highlight to the shared `os-window` surface, clearing the redundant `glass-stack` helper while keeping the frosted grain tuned for the roadmap cards.
- Centralised the `.os-window` high-contrast fallback in the shared animations sheet so hero story shells and timeline highlights stay consistent without route-level overrides.
- Added high-contrast custom properties to `.os-window` and removed redundant CTA, founders, and partners overrides so every shared surface can lean on the centralized fallback.
- Routed the partners metrics block and client roster through `surface-panel`, publishing the new `.os-window` high-contrast tokens from the home CTA so bespoke overrides stay cleared.
- Re-tuned the community metrics window, consulting testimonial, and contact hero CTA shells with branded glass mixes and published high-contrast tokens so each section inherits the shared `.os-window` fallbacks without losing its palette.
- Refreshed the `/products` hero spotlights, catalog cards, and demo previews with accent-aware `os-window` tokens, updated frame chrome, and published high-contrast fallbacks while logging the upgrade in the shared plan.
- Reworked the global footer columns and closing rail on the shared `.os-window` tokens with high-contrast fallbacks so the site-wide surfaces stay aligned with the refreshed glass palette.
- Recast the sticky navigation shell and dropdown panels on shared `.os-window` tokens, retuning gradient grain mixes, dark-mode hues, and HC fallbacks so the header and mobile menu stay consistent with the refreshed glass palette.
- Migrated toast notifications onto the shared `.os-window` shell with accent-aware glass tokens, tuned grain overlays, and HC-safe borders so ephemeral feedback matches the refreshed surface rollout.
- Ported the floating AI companion chat panel to the shared `.os-window` shell with accent glass tokens, tuned message and suggestion styling, and high-contrast-safe input controls so the assistant matches the refreshed surface rollout.
- Hardened the shared surface utilities with high-contrast custom properties for `.surface-chip`, `.surface-pill`, `.surface-field`, and `.surface-panel`, removed the unused `.glass` helper, and retuned founders/partners shells to consume the new fallbacks.
- Retuned the home hero pillars, milestone window, and signal readouts with accent-aware `os-window` tokens, shifted the milestone navigation controls onto the shared pill/chip utilities, and dropped redundant high-contrast overrides now that the centralized fallbacks cover the section.
- Rebalanced the community voting feature cards and idea submission panel on accent-aware `os-window` tokens, tuning their dark-mode blends and high-contrast fallbacks so the interactive surfaces stay legible without bespoke overrides.
- Reimagined the global loading overlay as a frosted status shell that leans on shared glass tokens, updated spinner colours, and high-contrast plus reduced-motion safeguards so the entry experience matches the refreshed surface system.
- Floated the animated background system above the neutral shell by softening the page backdrop colour mix, lifted the grain layer behind the canvas, and standardized `.section` spacing + transparent containers so every route now reveals the motion field without white blockouts.
