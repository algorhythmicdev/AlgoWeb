# Progress Log

- Implemented the IG-grade hero animation system from **site vision.pdf**, covering aurora-flow, glass-parallax, grid-ripple, particle-drift, and line-sweep variants plus the new typographic reveal headline treatment and neutral hero overlays.
- Delivered the AAA-aligned interaction system from **site vision.pdf** with neutral primary/secondary CTAs, high-contrast-aware chip and badge tokens, table and input guardrails, and theme switching upgraded to the light/dark/HC map with `hc` compatibility in the progress toggle.
- Routed the products, community, consulting, and contact heroes through the shared **HeroBackdrop** system so each page now uses a distinct spec-aligned animation combo with HC/reduced-motion fallbacks tuned to the token map.
- Remaining: tighten form validation feedback to pair icons + helper text per spec, wire arrow-key/roving tabindex into the language switcher, and add automated checks around theme persistence + translation loading.
