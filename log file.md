# Progress Log

- Implemented the IG-grade hero animation system from **site vision.pdf**, covering aurora-flow, glass-parallax, grid-ripple, particle-drift, and line-sweep variants plus the new typographic reveal headline treatment and neutral hero overlays.
- Delivered the AAA-aligned interaction system from **site vision.pdf** with neutral primary/secondary CTAs, high-contrast-aware chip and badge tokens, table and input guardrails, and theme switching upgraded to the light/dark/HC map with `hc` compatibility in the progress toggle.
- Routed the products, community, consulting, and contact heroes through the shared **HeroBackdrop** system so each page now uses a distinct spec-aligned animation combo with HC/reduced-motion fallbacks tuned to the token map.
- Re-authored the entire English locale file with welcoming, tech-friendly language while preserving placeholders and aligning copy with the calm, AAA-focused design vision.
- Completed the remaining interaction refinements from **site vision.pdf**: elevated form feedback with helper copy and alert icons, delivered full roving tabindex + arrow-key control for the language switcher, and added Vitest coverage for theme persistence and translation loading guardrails.
- Stabilized the new accessibility helpers by replacing invalid Svelte bindings, wiring an action-based focus registry, and tuning FieldSupport styling so builds succeed cleanly alongside passing Vitest runs.
