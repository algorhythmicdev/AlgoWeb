# AlgoRhythmics — What We Do, What We Offer, and How It Works

## 1) Who we are

AlgoRhythmics is a Latvia-based, pre-company stage initiative building accessible AI tools and offering practical AI consulting. We start local (Latvia) and design for global scale. Our mission is to unlock useful AI for everyday people, schools, startups, and small businesses.  

**What this means in plain words:** we make simple, reliable apps and services that help you plan travel, run a young company, and learn modern AI skills—without jargon and without barriers.

---

## 2) What we do (the three pillars)

### A. Products (SaaS)

We build two main platforms:

* **NodeVoyage** – an AI-assisted travel planner with a “smart helper” (Nodi) for trip ideas, route optimization, and collaboration. It focuses on useful planning, real-time adjustments, and sustainable choices.   
* **Ideonautix** – a startup productivity suite with modules like Pomodoro Coach, Pitch Assistant, and Competitive Intelligence. It helps teams organize work, prepare pitches, and track competitors.   

### B. AI Consulting

We help organizations introduce AI into daily work: automation, data workflows, and training. We focus on practical outcomes and clear hand-off so teams can run independently. 

### C. Education (with partners)

We design programs and teacher training to bring AI literacy to Latvian schools and universities, working toward wide reach with LIAA (Latvian Investment and Development Agency). Targets include 80% of institutions, 25k+ students per year, and 500+ trained teachers over time.

## 3) Our products in detail

### NodeVoyage — travel planning that stays useful

**What it is:** a clear planner where you add places (“nodes” like stays, activities, transport, food), and Nodi suggests options, sequences them, and keeps everything tidy for solo or group trips.  

**Key capabilities (simple list):**

* Smart suggestions and trip optimization with Google/AI data. 
* Real-time collaboration and version history (like “track changes” for trips). 
* Sustainability tracking (carbon estimates, eco alternatives, points). 

**Planned pricing for Latvia:** Free tier for basics; Premium ~€2.99/month (or €29.99/year); family and student discounts. The goal is affordability first. 

**Rollout (high-level):**
MVP (core planning) → AI enhancement (voice, advanced recs, collaboration) → community features → API/analytics.  

### Ideonautix — a compact toolkit for young companies

**What it is:** modular tools that founders actually use—focus timer with team sync, pitch deck assistant, competitor tracking, and more.   

**Example modules (plain words):**

* **Pomodoro Coach:** adaptive focus sessions, calendar-aware, team sync. 
* **Pitch Assistant:** draft decks and notes from a short brief, then auto-check structure. 
* **Competitive Intelligence:** watch competitor sites/socials and notify on changes.

## 4) How we build (tech, security, and accessibility)

**Frontend:** SvelteKit + TypeScript with strong accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA/AAA), responsive layout, dark/light modes, and six languages (EN/LV/RU/UK/FR/ES).  

**Backend & Cloud:** Google Cloud (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL/Postgres, Firestore, Storage, Redis), Fastify APIs, Prisma ORM, OpenAPI docs, CI/CD. 

**AI layer:** Vertex AI (primary) with OpenAI as fallback; on-device ML where it helps with privacy. 

**Realtime & quality:** WebSockets for collaboration, tests across unit/integration/E2E/accessibility, and CI/CD pipelines.  

**Security & privacy:** GDPR-first, encryption, role-based access, and monitoring. 

---

## 5) How we price and grow (Latvia first)

* **Inclusive entry pricing** (€1–€3 starting points) and education discounts to lower barriers. 
* **NodeVoyage** free + low-cost premium plans; student/family options. 
* Marketing centers on schools, students, and local startup communities, with clear KPIs (institutions reached, teacher training, content/SEO, events).  

**Financial outlook (illustrative targets, not promises):** clear ARR and user goals, with risk scenarios and mitigation (pricing flexibility, education partnerships).  

---

## 6) Education program (what schools actually get)

* **Teacher training (multi-level):** from basics to “AI leadership” tracks (program design, policy, mentoring). 
* **Student reach goals and measurement:** targets, surveys, skills portfolios, and annual impact reporting.   
* **Partnership model with LIAA:** clear structure, shared events, curriculum input, and benefits for both sides.   

---

## 7) Roadmap and operations (how we execute)

**Roadmap:** a shared platform strategy (auth, multi-tenant DB, AI integration layer, analytics), then product-specific steps for NodeVoyage and Ideonautix.  

**Team & process:** lean, distributed, with clear roles for CEO and CTO; agile sprints, quality gates, and hiring phases after funding.    

---

## 8) Why this matters (short, direct)

* People get **useful AI** they can actually use today.
* Schools get **structured programs** with measurable impact.
* Startups get **focused tools** that reduce noise and save time.
* Pricing stays **fair** and **local-friendly**, then scales outward.   

---

## 9) Quick glossary (plain language)

* **AI assistant (Nodi):** software that suggests and organizes trip steps for you. 
* **SaaS:** subscription apps you use in a browser or phone.
* **WCAG:** accessibility rules that make apps readable and usable for more people. 
* **Vertex AI / OpenAI:** services we use to run language and reasoning models. 

---

## 10) Where this is going (focus, not hype)

* Launch in Latvia with clear milestones, improve with real feedback, and expand to EU when metrics say “go.”
* Keep the tools fast, simple, multi-language, and accessible; keep education central; keep consulting practical.
