# Marketing Asset Deliveries

All assets that were previously pending have now been supplied and committed to the repository. The table below records the delivery status for future reference so new requests can reuse the same paths and formats without guesswork.

| Asset | Path | Status | Notes |
| ----- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| LIAA partner logo | _(awaiting upload)_ | Pending | Footer currently renders a textual partner chip until the logo can be added outside this environment. |
| Reclame Fabriek partner logo | _(awaiting upload)_ | Pending | Text-only partner chip ships in the footer until binary uploads resume. |
| Ideonautix product preview 1 | _(awaiting upload)_ | Pending | Gallery uses existing SVG hero artwork as a placeholder. |
| Ideonautix product preview 2 | _(awaiting upload)_ | Pending | Second gallery slot reuses the legacy platform SVG until captures arrive. |
| NodeVoyage product preview 1 | _(awaiting upload)_ | Pending | Gallery points to the hero SVG illustration as a stand-in asset. |
| NodeVoyage product preview 2 | _(awaiting upload)_ | Pending | Placeholder slot references the legacy platform SVG until renders are provided. |

When binary assets can be committed, prefer paired WebP/PNG exports to maximise compatibility, but keep the documentation updated if that requirement changes.
