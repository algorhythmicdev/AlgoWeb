# Marketing Asset Deliveries

Several marketing exports still need to be added outside this environment. The table below records the delivery status so new requests can reuse the same paths and formats without guesswork once binaries are available.

| Asset | Path | Status | Notes |
| ----- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| LIAA partner logo | _(awaiting upload)_ | Pending | Footer currently renders a textual partner chip until the logo can be added outside this environment. |
| Reclame Fabriek partner logo | _(awaiting upload)_ | Pending | Text-only partner chip ships in the footer until binary uploads resume. |
| Ideonautix product preview 1 | _(awaiting upload)_ | Pending | Gallery currently references `/images/products/ideonautix-hero.svg` as a stand-in. |
| Ideonautix product preview 2 | _(awaiting upload)_ | Pending | Second gallery slot reuses `/images/placeholders/platform-ideonautix.svg` until captures arrive. |
| NodeVoyage product preview 1 | _(awaiting upload)_ | Pending | Gallery points to `/images/products/nodevoyage-hero.svg` as the interim asset. |
| NodeVoyage product preview 2 | _(awaiting upload)_ | Pending | Placeholder slot references `/images/placeholders/platform-nodevoyage.svg` until renders are provided. |

When binary assets can be committed, prefer paired WebP/PNG exports to maximise compatibility, but keep the documentation updated if that requirement changes.
