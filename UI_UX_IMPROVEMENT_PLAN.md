AlgoRhythmics.dev – UX/UI Remediation Log
=========================================

All tracker items from the original plan (C1–C7, M1–M4, D1–D3) have been resolved in the codebase.
This log captures the verification notes and source-of-truth files for future audits.

Resolved Critical Issues
------------------------
- **C1 – Theme system unified:** Runtime tokens live in [`src/lib/styles/theme.css`](src/lib/styles/theme.css) and [`src/lib/styles/global.css`](src/lib/styles/global.css); the toggle at [`src/lib/components/theme-toggle.svelte`](src/lib/components/theme-toggle.svelte) switches light, dark, and high-contrast modes without legacy artifacts.
- **C2 – Navigation/routes consolidated:** [`src/lib/components/Navigation.svelte`](src/lib/components/Navigation.svelte) and [`src/lib/components/Footer.svelte`](src/lib/components/Footer.svelte) render a shared platform catalogue driven by [`src/lib/config/navigation.js`](src/lib/config/navigation.js); redundant routes have been removed.
- **C3 – Hero system standardised:** All routes import [`src/lib/components/Hero.svelte`](src/lib/components/Hero.svelte) and variant fragments (e.g. AnimatedHeadline, HaloFX) so every hero respects the glass/grain/overlay pattern with AAA contrast.
- **C4 – Contrast & accessibility:** Surfaces, buttons, and overlays pull from the theme tokens; global CSS honours `prefers-reduced-motion` and high-contrast attributes, and axe-based regression tests (`tests/accessibility.spec.ts`) pass.
- **C5 – Cards & panels:** [`src/lib/components/GlassCard.svelte`](src/lib/components/GlassCard.svelte) underpins timeline entries, founders, partners, and CTA panels, delivering consistent elevation and grain effects.
- **C6 – Content deduplicated & keyed:** All copy originates from [`src/lib/i18n/en.json`](src/lib/i18n/en.json) (with fallbacks guarded by `translateOrFallback` helpers), and the new `unkeyed-text.spec.ts` test blocks stray literals.
- **C7 – Redundant assets removed:** Only the current hero, card, animation, and theme modules remain under `src/lib`; the unused `src/app.css` aggregate has been deleted so the layout’s tokenised imports are the single source of styling.

Resolved Moderate Issues
------------------------
- **M1 – Button/CTA consistency:** [`src/lib/components/Button.svelte`](src/lib/components/Button.svelte) enforces tokenised states, shared focus rings, and motion patterns across the site.
- **M2 – Layout & spacing grid:** Responsive clamps and grid utilities reside in [`src/lib/styles/layout-grid.css`](src/lib/styles/layout-grid.css); sections such as the home story, platforms, and consulting forms use these classes exclusively.
- **M3 – Timeline filters & styling:** The home route (`src/routes/+page.svelte`) renders timeline entries via GlassCards with accessible filter buttons and neutral badges.
- **M4 – Footer redesign:** [`Footer.svelte`](src/lib/components/Footer.svelte) now delivers a single glass surface with four semantic columns and accent-hover links.

Resolved Minor Issues
---------------------
- **D1 – Animation polish:** HaloFX, AnimatedBackground, and reveal utilities animate heroes and cards smoothly while respecting reduced-motion preferences.
- **D2 – Iconography alignment:** [`src/lib/components/icons`](src/lib/components/icons) exports a consistent outline-based set with shared stroke weights and theme-aware fills.
- **D3 – SEO/meta hygiene:** Each route defines canonical URLs, meta tags, and aria labelling (see `src/routes/**/+page.svelte` head blocks and component attributes).

Regression Guardrails
---------------------
- Run `npm run lint` to combine translation sync checks with ESLint.
- Run `npm test` to execute accessibility, content, store, icon, and unkeyed-text guards.
