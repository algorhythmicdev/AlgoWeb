# UI and UX Review Report

_Last reviewed: 2025-10-05_

This document captures the current state of the AlgoRhythmics marketing site after a full interface, accessibility, and localization review. It covers both light and dark themes, interaction quality, translation coverage, and asset alignment.

## Review Scope

- Home, products, community, consulting, and contact routes
- Global components (navigation, footer, toasts, AI companion, background system)
- Light and dark theme rendering across desktop and mobile breakpoints
- Six language locales (English, Latvian, Russian, Ukrainian, French, Spanish)
- Static assets referenced from the `static/` directory

## Findings Summary

| Area | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| Layout rendering | Stable | No layout shifts in desktop or mobile widths. Hero sections maintain spacing. |
| Light theme | Stable | Colors align with design tokens, glass surfaces readable. |
| Dark theme | Stable | Background gradients and surface tokens provide sufficient contrast. |
| Navigation | Minor issues | `aria-controls` now points to a real id; consider adding focus-trap for mobile menu. |
| Language switcher | Needs refinement | Escape key and focus return added; arrow navigation still pending. |
| Translations | Stable | All founders' names remain in English. Regional copy culturally localized. |
| Assets | Updated | `ASSETS.md` reflects current files under `static/`. |
| Icons | Stable | SVG icon component renders consistently and passes `svelte-check`. |

## Detailed Review

### Visual QA

- Checked hero, story, founders, timeline, and footer sections in both themes. No clipping or overlapping content observed down to a 360px viewport.
- Background animation layers respect reduced motion preferences and do not interfere with interaction targets.
- Product detail pages reuse card layouts with consistent spacing and gradient treatments.

### Interaction QA

- Navigation hides on downward scroll and reappears smoothly. Menu toggle closes after link selection. `aria-controls` now references the `primary-navigation` id for accessibility tooling.
- Theme toggle updates the `data-theme` attribute and persists choice in local storage.
- Community voting buttons retain state per session store; toast notifications use the shared `<Toast>` component.

### Localization QA

- Verified that brand, founder, and city names are preserved in English across all locale files.
- No missing translation keys encountered during runtime inspection. Fallback copies in `en.json` stay in sync with the UI.
- Locale switcher updates content immediately without requiring a full page reload.

### Accessibility Review

- Interactive elements have visible focus states derived from design tokens.
- Navigation toggle exposes `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`; follow-up work should add escape-key support to the language dropdown and ensure focus returns to the trigger when closed.
- Icon component hides decorative SVGs with `aria-hidden="true"` and uses stroke/fill classes compatible with both themes.

## Recommendations

1. Enhance the language dropdown with arrow-key navigation and roving tabindex patterns so it fully matches WCAG guidance for custom menus.
2. Consider lazy-loading partner logos to lower initial payload on slower connections.
3. Add unit or component tests around theme persistence and translation loading to guard against regressions.
4. Document how to rotate product imagery and update partner lists when assets change.

## Verification Checklist

- `npm run check`
- `npm run build`
- Manual theme toggle review in Chromium and Firefox
- Manual locale switching across all six languages

## Asset Alignment

The asset manifest in `ASSETS.md` has been refreshed to match the current `static/images` directory and to clarify each file's intent. Keep this document in sync when new partner logos or product renders are introduced.
