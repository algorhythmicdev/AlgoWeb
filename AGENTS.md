Jules attempts to setup your environment according to hints in your codebase and agents.md. Optionally, you can provide a setup script to be run explicitly. No need for clone commands, the repo will be cloned automatically into the /app directory.

After a successful test of the setup script, your environment will be snapshotted for faster startups. For more information and a list of default toolsets installed see the environment setup documentation.
